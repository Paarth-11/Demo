<center><h3>ABOUT REAL MADRID</h3></center>
<center><pre>Real Madrid is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid. Playing in
all-white uniforms, which led to its nickname “Los Blancos,” Real Madrid is one of the world’s best-known
teams, with fans in many countries.
Real Madrid grew out of Football Club Sky, a team formed in Madrid in 1897. The club was officially founded in 1902 and
joined the Royal Spanish Football Federation in 1909. Real Madrid played at a variety of venues until ambitious club president
Santiago Bernabéu spearheaded the construction of the stadium that bears his name. Opened in 1947, the Bernabéu holds more than 80,000 spectators and was the venue 
for the 1982 Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup final.</pre></center>

<p>Club captain Martin Odegaard led by example last season, and was duly named Arsenal Player of the Season after a stellar campaign in which he amassed 15 goals – all in the Premier League – to jointly top Arsenal's scoring charts from midfield. Blessed with incredible vision and awareness, as well as a clinical edge – he bagged braces at Bournemouth, Wolves and at home to Chelsea. He was named Premier League Player of the Month for November/December, and won the Arsenal.com honour for April 2023. 
The left-footed attacking midfielder is now in his fourth season with Arsenal, having initially joined on loan from Real Madrid in January 2021. A creative, technical player, he can play in a variety of positions, and last season he was highly effective playing behind the front three, and was nominated for the Premier League Player of the Season, Premier League Young Player of the Season and the FWA Footballer of the Year awards. </p>

<p>A dynamic forward with a wealth of Premier League experience, Gabriel Jesus hit the ground running in his first season, scoring and assisting twice in his home debut against Leicester City. The striker, who can also play in a deeper role or out wide, was named Arsenal.com Player of the Month for August, and would go on to amass a combined 18 goals plus assists in his first season with Arsenal, despite missing a large chunk of the campaign with a knee injury. The Brazil international won four Premier League titles with previous club Manchester City, as well as one FA Cup and three League Cups. He scored 95 goals for the club but is also known for his creativity, fighting spirit and link up play. </p><br>

<p>It was another season of incredible development and progress for Bukayo Saka, who reached double figures for both goals and assists in the Premier League. Mainly operating on the right wing, the creative, skilful youngster was ever-present for the second season in a row in the league – the first player to do this for us in back-to-back campaigns since David Seaman in 1990/91 and 1991/92. 
The leading goalscorer, assister and appearance-maker in the current squad, he became the second youngest player in our history to rack up 100 Premier League appearances in August 2022, and won the Premier League Player of the Month award for March 2023. </p><br>

<p>Cultured French defender William Saliba made his long-awaited Arsenal debut last season after initially signing for the club in July 2019 – and it was worth the wait. The stylish, pacy centre back impressed from the start and was a key component in a defence that conceded just 11 goals in 14 Premier League games before the World Cup, where he was a member of the France squad that reached the final. 
Saliba netted his first Arsenal goal at AFC Bournemouth in just his third appearance, his sumptuous curling effort scooping our Goal of the Month award for August.</p><br>
