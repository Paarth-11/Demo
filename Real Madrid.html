<center><h3>ABOUT REAL MADRID</h3></center>
<center><pre>Real Madrid is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid. Playing in
all-white uniforms, which led to its nickname “Los Blancos,” Real Madrid is one of the world’s best-known
teams, with fans in many countries.
Real Madrid grew out of Football Club Sky, a team formed in Madrid in 1897. The club was officially founded in 1902 and
joined the Royal Spanish Football Federation in 1909. Real Madrid played at a variety of venues until ambitious club president
Santiago Bernabéu spearheaded the construction of the stadium that bears his name. Opened in 1947, the Bernabéu holds more than 80,000 spectators and was the venue 
for the 1982 Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup final.</pre></center>
<center><h2>PLAYERS</h2></center>
<center><img src="Jude Bellingham.jpg" width="80%"></center><br>
<p>At just 20 years of age, Jude Bellingham is one of the footballing sensations in Europe today. His season at Real Madrid has amazed the club and its supporters around the world, but before he arrived at the Santiago Bernabeu, his football had captivated Borussia Dortmund. It also caught the attention of his fellow professionals, who voted Bellingham as one of the 23 finalists for the 2023 FIFA FIFPRO Men’s World 11.
The 2023 team of the year, which as always rewards the best players in each position, has a special feature compared to previous occasions: it is based on performances in the second half of last season, after the 2022 World Cup. </p>
<br>
<center><img src="Vinicius Junior.jpg" width="80%"></center><br>
<p>Since joining Real Madrid, Vini Jr. has established himself as one of the most promising young talents in world football. He possesses excellent technical abilities, including impressive dribbling skills and a keen eye for goal.
He has also shown great versatility, and is capable of playing on both wings, although he is primarily a left winger and has made that role his own since Carlo Ancelotti returned for a second stint at Real Madrid in 2021.
In his debut season with Real Madrid, Vini Jr. was one of the few lone bright spots in an otherwise disastrous campaign, making his breakthrough under Santiago Solari, before an injury against Ajax in the second leg of the UEFA Champions League Round of 16 ended his season.</p><br>
<center><img src="Luka Modric.jpg" width="80%"></center><br>
<p>Throughout his career, Modrić has established himself as a player with exceptional technical skills and tactical intelligence. He is known for his ability to control the game from midfield, using his vision and passing range to create opportunities for his team. His skill on the ball, combined with his work rate and tenacity, have made him a valuable asset to any team for whom he has played.
At Real Madrid, Modrić has been a key player in the team's success in recent years. He has won numerous titles, including five UEFA Champions Leagues, and has played an instrumental role in the team's dominance of European football. His performances on the pitch have earned him numerous accolades, including the Ballon d'Or in 2018.</p><br>
<center><img src="Rodrygo.jpg" width="80%"></center><br>
<p>Signed from Santos in a deal worth €45 million (£39m/$52m) as a 17-year-old, the Brazilian teenager arrived in the Spanish capital at the start of the 2019-20 season, with the belief that he would spend much of the campaign representing the club’s Castilla side, who play in the third tier of Spanish football. 
But with big-money summer signings Eden Hazard and Luka Jovic struggling for fitness and form respectively, by the end of September he was thrust into the first team by Zinedine Zidane.
Within 93 seconds of being introduced as a substitute for his debut against Osasuna he had found the net, jinking inside a defender before curling a right-footed shot into the bottom corner. 
His celebration? A bow to each corner of Santiago Bernabeu. Madridistas had a new hero to worship. </p><br>
