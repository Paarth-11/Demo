<center><h3>ABOUT ARSENAL</h3></center>
<center><pre>Arsenal Football Club was established in 1886 by a group of
munitions workers looking to build a community away from their
challenging work in the Woolwich Armaments factory. From those
humble beginnings, Arsenal has now reached millions of supporters around the
world. They have pioneered the game at all levels through the ages,
from their ground-breaking teams of the 1930s and 2000s, to
establishing what has become the most successful women’s team in
history in 1987 and providing community programmes to thousands of
people in their local boroughs and beyond.</pre></center>

<p>Club captain Martin Odegaard led by example last season, and was duly named Arsenal Player of the Season after a stellar campaign in which he amassed 15 goals – all in the Premier League – to jointly top our scoring charts from midfield. Blessed with incredible vision and awareness, as well as a clinical edge – he bagged braces at Bournemouth, Wolves and at home to Chelsea. He was named Premier League Player of the Month for November/December, and won the Arsenal.com honour for April 2023. 
The left-footed attacking midfielder is now in his fourth season with us, having initially joined on loan from Real Madrid in January 2021. A creative, technical player, he can play in a variety of positions, and last season he was highly effective playing behind the front three, and was nominated for the Premier League Player of the Season, Premier League Young Player of the Season and the FWA Footballer of the Year awards. </p>
