<center><h3>ABOUT ARSENAL</h3></center>
<center><pre>Arsenal Football Club was established in 1886 by a group of
munitions workers looking to build a community away from their
challenging work in the Woolwich Armaments factory. From those
humble beginnings, Arsenal has now reached millions of supporters around the
world. They have pioneered the game at all levels through the ages,
from their ground-breaking teams of the 1930s and 2000s, to
establishing what has become the most successful women’s team in
history in 1987 and providing community programmes to thousands of
people in their local boroughs and beyond.</pre></center>
<center><h2>PLAYERS</h2></center>
<center><img src="Martin Odegaard.jpg" width="80%"></center><br>
<p>Club captain Martin Odegaard led by example last season, and was duly named Arsenal Player of the Season after a stellar campaign in which he amassed 15 goals – all in the Premier League – to jointly top Arsenal's scoring charts from midfield. Blessed with incredible vision and awareness, as well as a clinical edge – he bagged braces at Bournemouth, Wolves and at home to Chelsea. He was named Premier League Player of the Month for November/December, and won the Arsenal.com honour for April 2023. 
The left-footed attacking midfielder is now in his fourth season with Arsenal, having initially joined on loan from Real Madrid in January 2021. A creative, technical player, he can play in a variety of positions, and last season he was highly effective playing behind the front three, and was nominated for the Premier League Player of the Season, Premier League Young Player of the Season and the FWA Footballer of the Year awards. </p>
<br>

<p>A dynamic forward with a wealth of Premier League experience, Gabriel Jesus hit the ground running in his first season, scoring and assisting twice in his home debut against Leicester City. The striker, who can also play in a deeper role or out wide, was named Arsenal.com Player of the Month for August, and would go on to amass a combined 18 goals plus assists in his first season with Arsenal, despite missing a large chunk of the campaign with a knee injury. The Brazil international won four Premier League titles with previous club Manchester City, as well as one FA Cup and three League Cups. He scored 95 goals for the club but is also known for his creativity, fighting spirit and link up play. </p><br>
<center><img src="Bukayo Saka.jpg" width="80%"></center><br>
<p>It was another season of incredible development and progress for Bukayo Saka, who reached double figures for both goals and assists in the Premier League. Mainly operating on the right wing, the creative, skilful youngster was ever-present for the second season in a row in the league – the first player to do this for us in back-to-back campaigns since David Seaman in 1990/91 and 1991/92. 
The leading goalscorer, assister and appearance-maker in the current squad, he became the second youngest player in our history to rack up 100 Premier League appearances in August 2022, and won the Premier League Player of the Month award for March 2023. </p><br>
<center><img src="William Saliba.jpg" width="80%"></center><br>
<p>Cultured French defender William Saliba made his long-awaited Arsenal debut last season after initially signing for the club in July 2019 – and it was worth the wait. The stylish, pacy centre back impressed from the start and was a key component in a defence that conceded just 11 goals in 14 Premier League games before the World Cup, where he was a member of the France squad that reached the final. 
Saliba netted his first Arsenal goal at AFC Bournemouth in just his third appearance, his sumptuous curling effort scooping our Goal of the Month award for August.</p><br>
