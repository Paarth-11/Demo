<pre>Arsenal Football Club was established in 1886 by a group of
munitions workers looking to build a community away from their
challenging work in the Woolwich Armaments factory. From those
humble beginnings, Arsenal has now reached millions of supporters around the
world. They have pioneered the game at all levels through the ages,
from their ground-breaking teams of the 1930s and 2000s, to
establishing what has become the most successful womenâ€™s team in
history in 1987 and providing community programmes to thousands of
people in their local boroughs and beyond.</pre>
