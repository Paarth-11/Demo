<center><h3>ABOUT BAYERN</h3></center>
<center><pre>Germany’s most famous and successful soccer (association football) team 
is Bayern Munich, based in the southern city of Munich. The club was founded in 1900,
but almost all of its success has come since the 1960s.
Bayern Munich was formed when members of the MTV 1879 Munich sports club broke away to form their
own club. After winning the South German Championship in 1926, the club won its first national title in 
1932. After World War II, soccer in West Germany was played in five regional leagues, the top divisions
of which were called Oberliga. Bayern played in the Oberliga Süd (South) and won the German Cup for
the first time in 1957. In 1963 a West German national league, called the Bundesliga, was launched,
and Bayern joined for the 1965–66 season.</pre></center>

With the exception of a few short loan spells, the London-born striker went in search of goals for the Lillywhites for almost 20 years (2004-2023) and became Spurs' record goalscorer with 280 in all competitive fixtures.

In 2019, he reached the Champions League final with Tottenham for the first time in the club's history, but Spurs lost 2-0 to Liverpool. This season at Bayern, Kane has scored more goals than the number of matches he has played- 32 goals in 29 games.
